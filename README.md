# canvas-game

Javascript exercise to understand concepts of game development without libraries or frameworks.

## Installation

```bash
yarn install or npm install
```

You can run the project with the webpack output opening the index.html after building the project with `yarn build` or `npm run build`

For development I recommend using a live server rendering index.html (for example: with Live Server VSCode extension - id: ritwickdey.liveserver). Then, run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` so you can have webpack watching for file changes.
